Available as part of the official [Macaulay2](https://www.macaulay2.com/) release as of version 1.23. See [here](https://www.macaulay2.com/doc/Macaulay2/share/doc/Macaulay2/Macaulay2Doc/html/_changes_cm_sp1.23.html) for the full Macaulay2 version 1.23 changelog.
## Overview
This Macaulay2 package allows one to compute Gr√∂bner bases, syzygies and free resolutions for submodules of free OI-modules over Noetherian polynomial OI-algebras. For an introduction to the topic, see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09247v2) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06725).
